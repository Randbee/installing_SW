postgres 9.6 and postgis 2.3 were released on Sept 2016 
these versions are not on http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages

It is common to not put on ubuntu official repositories new packages. They are put there after debuggins and trouble shooting: this version will be stable (it won't change anymore)

the repos where you can install these versions lead to "unstable" packages and broken dependences


postgres 9.6 and postgis 2.3 are are built into zesty (ubuntu 17)

Package: Postgis

Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14), libgdal20 (>= 2.0.1), libgeos-c1v5 (>= 3.4.2), liblwgeom-2.2-5 (>= 2.0.0), libpq5


libgdal1
		it is in conflincty with libgdal1h
		it is not into my packages

libgeos-c1
		replaced by libgeos-c1v5 on trusty and xenial

liblwgeom 
		postgresql-9.3-postgis-2.2 uses 2.2-5		
		(>= 2.2.0)
		it depences of libgeos-c1v5

libgdal1h	not present on trusty
		repleased by libgdal1i on xenial
		libgdal1i replaces libgdal1 and libgdal1h

I suppose it is a issue with the version of ubuntu: install xenial

use the command pg_upgrade

postgres version	9.6
postgis version 	2.3 

##############postgresql##############
###USAGE###

in the work station there is a specific installation directory 
moving old cluster not necessary

if it is like that move the directory
doing (fake directories):


mv /usr/local/pgsql /usr/local/pgsql.old

- build the new version 
  


##############postgis##############

postgis is a "run-time loadable library" for postgresql
it is a library file written in C called postgis-2.2.so (postgis version 2.2)
to enable the postgis function it is necessary to run CREATE EXTENSION postgis


SELECT * 
  FROM pg_proc 
  WHERE proname = 'st_pointonsurface';


the most important part of the o utput is:
probin          | $libdir/postgis-2.2

it means that the function is bound to a particular version of the postgis library
