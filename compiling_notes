##COMPILING FROM SOURCE##
source codes are in the form of compressed tar files

.tar		.tar.gz or .tar.bz2
tools for unpacking and packing 'tar', 'gzip', 'bzip'

to download the file we use
	
		
		wget <link to the tarball>

NOTE: download the software on the current directory


Depending on the extension use: 

$ tar -xvfz <name of tarball with .tar.gz extension>
(or)
$ tar -xvfj <name of tarball with tar.bz2 extension>
